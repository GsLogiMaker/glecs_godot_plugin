# Nightly build of Glecs - Godot (fast) Lightweight Entity Component System
Ready to use, built hot from the dev branch. Be weary, bugs are highly likely, as this branch is intended for testing purposes.
### Installation
To install the nightly build in your Godot project, open a terminal in the `res://addons` folder of your project and run the following command:
```
git install https://github.com/GsLogiMaker/g_ecs_plugin.git -b nightly
```
Next, open the projects settings and under the "Plugins" tab, enable GlecsNightly, and you are ready to use Glecs nightly!
